    <p class="center">
        Hi, my name is Bryan Waymire and I am 23 years old and was born and raised in West Palm Beach, FL.
        I'm not your typical guy as I am not interested in sports, cars, or going out to the club.
        I like learning and growing, meditating, yoga, and helping others.
        I plan to learn a lot in my future, start my own business, and have a positive impact on the world.
      </p>
    <h2 class="center">My Background</h2>
      <p class="center">I graduated from Palm Beach State College with an AA degree in 2012 and I am now currently
      enrolled in a Health Coach program taught by the Health Coach Institute, learning to code,
        and learning American Sign Language.</p>
    <h2 class="center">Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h2>
      <p class="center">I decided to learn programming because I've always been interested in how things work and
      I grew up spending a lot of time on the computer and playing video games; it's a natural environment for me.
        I know that learning to code can open up new doors for me and will allow me to take the next step in life and to take control of my future.</p>
